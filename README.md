Starting off with a blog...

We will need to define models for animals still, lots to do. 
If you want to run the environment locally follow these simple steps:
Now you are ready to clone the repo... 
  - But first create your project directory, usually <code>C:\Development\Workspace\ [project name]</code>
  - Copy the repo-url from this Github repo using the clone or download (green button above.) 
  - Plug the copied url into Github Desktop to clone / download it onto your PC, and into the [project name] folder you created.
  - You will need to download and install python 3.7.x
  - Pip (the python package manager) should come with python, so once installed run these commands:
      <code>pip install django</code> & <code>pip install wagtail</code>
  - Now this part's a little tricky. After downloading and installing requirements / dependencies onto your PC (I think this is needed), 
      run this command from the cmd prompt at your [project name] directory: <code>pipenv run python manage.py runserver</code> 
  
  That should runserver for you to be able to hop onto your browser and type the address <code>localhost:8000</code> to view the site.
  Happy fiddling! :smiley: (please give me a shout if you need help ;) :coffee:
